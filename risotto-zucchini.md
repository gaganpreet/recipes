From Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking

For 6 servings

## Ingredients

* 4 medium or 6 small zucchini
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 3 tablespoons onion chopped coarse
* ½ teaspoon garlic chopped very fine
* Salt
* 5 cups Basic Homemade Meat Broth, OR 1 cup canned beef broth diluted with 4 cups water
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 cups Arborio or other imported Italian risotto rice
* Black pepper, ground fresh from the mill
* ¼ cup freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, plus additional cheese at the table
* 1 tablespoon chopped parsley

## Instructions

1. Soak the zucchini in cold water, scrub them clean, and cut off both ends. Cut the cleaned zucchini into disks ½ inch thick.

2. Put all the vegetable oil and the chopped onion in a broad, sturdy pot, and turn on the heat to medium high. Cook and stir the onion until it becomes translucent, then add the chopped garlic. When the garlic becomes lightly colored, add the sliced zucchini, and turn the heat down to medium low. Cook for about 10 minutes, turning the zucchini from time to time, then add a pinch of salt. Continue cooking until the zucchini become colored a rich gold, another 15 minutes or so.

3. Bring the broth to a very slow, steady simmer on a burner near where you’ll be cooking the risotto.

4. Add 1 tablespoon butter to the zucchini and turn on the heat to high. Add the rice, stirring quickly and thoroughly until the grains are coated well.

5. Add ½ cup of simmering broth, and cook the rice following the directions in Steps 3 and 4 of the basic white risotto recipe.

6. Cook the rice until it is tender, but firm to the bite, with barely enough liquid remaining to make the consistency somewhat runny. Off heat, add a few grindings of pepper, the remaining tablespoon of butter, and all the grated Parmesan, and stir thoroughly until the cheese melts and clings to the rice. Taste and correct for salt. Mix in the chopped parsley. Transfer to a platter and serve promptly with grated Parmesan on the side.

Ahead-of-time note  The recipe may be cooked several hours or a day or two in advance up to this point. If resuming the same day, do not refrigerate the zucchini. When refrigerating, store tightly covered with plastic wrap.
