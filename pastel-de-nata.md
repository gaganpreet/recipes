PASTÉIS DE NATA (10 to 12 units):

### Ingredients

* 250 gr of milk
* 150 gr of sugar
* 75 gr water
* 30 gr of flour (for cakes, not with yeast)
* 4 egg yolks
* 1 or 2 cinnamon sticks
* 3 or 4 lemon peels
* About 300gr of de custard dough (preferably homemade, recipe below this one)
* Cinnamon Powder (optional)


## Insructions

* Put into a pan the water and sugar to boil, mixing before to dissolve the sugar and NOT STIRRING IT while it’s boiling. You can shake a bit the pan, but don’t stir it. Let it boil up to 3 minutes until it gets the ‘pearl point’ (basically when you put a spoon on the water and it drops very gently and sticky.

* Dissolve the flour in just a bit of cold milk and stir very well until it becomes a cream without lumps (everyone hates lumps!) Take the rest of the milk to a pan, with the cinnamon sticks and the lemon peel. Turn up the heat of your stove, just until it starts boiling.

* Take it out of the heat, and join the flour mix from before, but little by little, always stirring with a wire whisk if you have one. Then put it back in the heat and keep stirring until it becomes creamy and dense.

* Then you should join the sugar "syrup" you did in the beginning, very slowly stirring with the wire whisk, to avoid lumps again. Let it cool down for about 10 minutes.

* Pick a bit of this cream and add it to the yolks, stirring with a normal spoon for a bit. This will avoid that the yolks boiling (which would happen if you added them immediately to the cream).

* Then start adding the yolk mixture to the cream, stirring slowly to incorporate it well.

* Take out the cinnamon sticks and the lemon peel from the cream. You can use a kitchen strainer if you have one.

* Pick the dough now and spread it in a rectangle, with about 18/20cm per 33/35cm. Put a bit of water on the surface where you are working to make it easier to avoid the dough sticking. Then you should fold the rectangle in the shape of a cylinder (look up video)

* Cut small disks of about 2cm of thickness. Now pick a muffin tray or oven shaped things for custard tarts (don’t know the specific name). I would advise to butter it up if you are doing it on a muffin tray, as it will avoid that it sticks.

* Pass your thumb over water, and pick the small disks of dough you cut before, placing it on the bottom of the muffin tray places or oven shapes. With your wet thumb mold the dough to make it the custard tart shape, always making sure you don’t overdo it (to avoid holes). Take it 10 minutes to the fridge, before putting the cream inside.

* Put the cream inside, filling it up with ¾ of the shape. They will rise on the oven, but once they cool down, they become flat.

* Take it to the oven, pre-heated to 250ºC, or the maximum your oven can take. Use the fan mode if your oven has it. The oven should be really hot before you put it inside. AVOID LEAVING THE DOOR OF THE OVEN OPEN FOR MORE THAN 3 SECONDS, AS THE TEMPERATURE DROPS VERY QUICKLY (credits for the tip: /u/nunomerkl) . The pastries should stay 10/12 minutes, or until you see them getting brownish/dark on top, which normally means they are ready.
