From Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking

For 6 servings

## Ingredients

5 cups Basic Homemade Meat Broth, OR 1 cup canned beef broth diluted with 4 cups water
2 tablespoons diced pancetta or prosciutto
3 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons onion chopped very fine
2 cups Arborio or other imported Italian risotto rice
⅓ teaspoon powdered saffron OR ½ teaspoon chopped saffron strands dissolved in 1 cup hot broth or water
Black pepper, ground fresh from the mill
⅓ cup freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, plus additional cheese at the table
Salt, if required

## Instructions

1. Bring the broth to a very slow, steady simmer on a burner near where you’ll be cooking the risotto.

2. Put the diced marrow, pancetta, or prosciutto, 1 tablespoon of butter, the vegetable oil, and the chopped onion in a broad, sturdy pot, and turn on the heat to medium high. Cook and stir the onion until it becomes translucent, then add the rice. Stir quickly and thoroughly until the grains are coated well.

3. Add ½ cup of simmering broth, and cook the rice following the directions in Steps 3 and 4 of the basic white risotto.

4. When the rice has cooked for 15 minutes, add half the dissolved saffron. Continue to stir, and when there is no more liquid in the pot, add the remaining saffron.

5. Finish cooking the rice, stirring always, until it is tender, but firm to the bite, and there is no more liquid in the pot.

6. Off heat, add a few grindings of pepper, the remaining butter, all the grated Parmesan, and stir thoroughly until the cheese melts and clings to the rice. Taste and correct for salt. Transfer to a platter and serve promptly with additional grated cheese on the side.
