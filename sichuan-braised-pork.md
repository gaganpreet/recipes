* 11⁄2-inch piece (30g) ginger, unpeeled 
* 2 scallions, white parts only 
* 2 tbsp cooking oil 
* 3 cups (700ml) everyday stock (see p. 463) 
* About 1 tbsp dark soy sauce or 11⁄2 tbsp caramel coloring (see p. 458)

### About

This dish is made with streaky pork belly, which is known poetically in Chinese as "five-flower meat" (wuhua rou) because of its layers of fat and lean. The meat and fat are braised to slow, tender perfection in a sauce that finally reduces to a dark, syrupy glaze, delicately flavored with star anise. It’s extremely easy to make and tastes sensational. 

The Sichuanese version of this universally popular Chinese dish is less dark and treacly than the Shanghainese. It’s often served alongside other braised dishes (shaocai) at casual “fly” restaurants, where you can assemble your meal from a gorgeous display of cold dishes, bubbling stews, jars of pickles and a great potful of rice. 

### Instructions

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the pork and blanch for 4–5 minutes; remove, rinse in cold water and cut into 11⁄4-inch (3–4cm) chunks. Lightly smack the ginger and scallion whites with the flat of a cleaver blade or a rolling pin to loosen them. 

Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pan until just beginning to smoke. Add the pork chunks and fry for a couple of minutes until the meat has “tightened.” If you wish, you can pour off any excess fat at this stage. 

Stir in all the other ingredients and bring to a boil. Simmer, half-covered or uncovered, over gentle heat for about 2 hours, stirring from time to time, until the meat is tender. Remove and discard the ginger and scallion whites.Before serving, adjust the seasoning and, if you wish, add a little extra soy sauce or caramel to deepen the color. You may also turn the heat up high to reduce and thicken the sauce. 

### Variations 

You can use the same method to cook spare ribs, rabbit or beef and some offal, although beef is more commonly red-braised by an alternative method that involves Sichuan chile bean paste (see p. 168).
