## Ginger Bug (Starter) for 5 Liters Batch

**Ingredients:**
- 500 ml filtered water (no chlorine, Amsterdam tap water is fine)
- 50 g fresh organic ginger, finely chopped or grated (with skin, scrubbed clean)
- 50 g sugar (white or raw)

**Instructions:**
1. In a clean 1-liter jar, combine water, ginger, and sugar. Stir well.
2. Cover with cheesecloth or a breathable cloth, secure with a rubber band.
3. Every day for 5–7 days, feed the bug with 25 g ginger and 25 g sugar, stirring each time.
4. After a few days, bubbles and a yeasty, gingery smell indicate the bug is active and ready.

## Ginger Beer (5 Liters)

**Ingredients:**
- 5 liters filtered water
- 120–150 g fresh organic ginger, peeled and grated (adjust to taste)
- 400 g sugar (white or a mix of white and brown; you can reduce to ~350 g for less sweetness)
- Juice of 2 lemons (about 100 ml)
- 150 ml strained ginger bug liquid (no solids)
- Optional: 1–2 limes (juice or zest), spices like 10 peppercorns and 7 cardamom pods for complexity.

**Instructions:**

1. In a large pot, combine about 1.5 liters of the water, grated ginger, and sugar.
2. Bring to a gentle simmer, stirring until the sugar is fully dissolved. Simmer for 5 minutes to extract ginger flavor.
3. Remove from heat and let the ginger syrup cool to room temperature (important to preserve live cultures).
4. Strain the syrup into a large fermenting container or clean bucket.
5. Add the remaining 3.5 liters of water, lemon juice, and the strained ginger bug liquid. Stir gently to combine.
6. If using, add lime juice/zest and spices now.
7. Funnel the mixture into clean plastic or flip-top bottles, leaving 3–4 cm headspace for carbonation.
8. Seal bottles tightly and leave at room temperature (18–22°C) for 2–5 days. Check daily and gently burp bottles to release excess pressure and avoid explosions.
9. When bottles feel firm and bubbly, refrigerate immediately to slow fermentation.
10. Serve chilled. Open carefully to avoid overflow.

### Notes:
- Sugar is necessary for fermentation but much is consumed by yeast, so the final drink is less sweet than the starting mix.
- Use plastic bottles for safety if you are new to fermentation.
- You can adjust ginger and lemon quantities to taste.
- This recipe is based on a blend of traditional and homebrew methods from Reddit fermentation communities and other sources.
