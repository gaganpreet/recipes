## Steps:
1. In a pressure cooker, add in the tender goat meat, ginger-garlic paste, fried onions, green chilies, turmeric powder, royal cumin, cinnamon stick, green cardamom pods, cloves, kebab chini or allspice or garam masala if kebab chini is not available), water and salt.
2. Stir the ingredients well and close the lid. Cook until the meat is nice and tender.
3. In a separate bowl, wash the broken wheat, barley, channa dal, split green gram, basmati rice, split red lentils and urad dal.
4. Transfer the washed mixture to a wok and add some water. Cook until it's nice, soft and tender.
5. Once the lentil mixture is ready, transfer the mutton to a strainer and separate the water, spices and bones.
6. Transfer the boneless meat and bone marrow into the lentil mixture and mix them well.
7. Mash the mixture with a help of a masher or wooden spoon until it has fragmented into little pieces and further down into single strand fibers.
8. Add desi ghee to this mixture along with fried onions (reserve some for garnish) and continue mashing.
9. Add in some meetha attar (optional) followed by mutton stock while mixing continuously.
10. Check for salt and add more if required.
11. Add in optional ingredients like dried/fresh rose petals or meetha attar if desired.
12. Give it a final mix before serving hot with mint leaves, lemon wedges and fried onions as garnish.

## Tips:
- Use tender goat meat on bone for best results as it adds flavor to the dish.
- Do not use boneless meat as it will compromise on flavor.
- Mash the mixture well to give Haleem its signature texture of shreds of boneless meat.
- Keep scraping the sides while mixing as Haleem becomes extra starchy due to all the starch in lentils, rice and wheat which can stick to the bottom or sides of pan if not stirred properly.
