## Steps:

1. In a pressure cooker, add the tender goat meat, ginger-garlic paste, fried onions, green chilies, turmeric powder, royal cumin, cinnamon stick, green
 cardamom pods, cloves, kebab chini or allspice or garam masala , water and salt. Stir the ingredients well.
2. Close the lid and let it cook until the meat is nice and tender.
3. In a bowl, wash the broken wheat, barley, channa dal, split green gram, basmati rice and split red lentils nicely.
4. Transfer the washed mixture of lentils to a wok and add some water. Cook it until it's nice, soft and tender.
5. Once the meat is cooked, transfer it to a strainer and separate the water, spices and bones.
6. Transfer the boneless meat and bone marrow into the lentil mixture and mix them well.
7. Mash the mixture with a help of a masher or wooden spoon until the meat has fragmented into little pieces and further down into single strand fibers.
8. Add desi ghee to this mixture along with fried onions (reserve some for garnish) and continue mashing.
9. Add in some meetha attar (optional) and give it a final mix.
10. Your Haleem is ready to be served hot, garnished with fried onions, mint leaves, lemon wedges.

## Tips:

- Do not use boneless meat as it will compromise on flavor.
- If kebab chini is not available, replace it with allspice or garam masala.
- Keep scraping the sides while mixing as Haleem becomes extra starchy extra creamy and starts sticking to the bottom or sides of the pan due to all the
 starch in lentils, rice, wheat etc.
