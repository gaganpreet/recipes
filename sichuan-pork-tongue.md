## Steps:

1. Boil the pork tongue in boiling water for 1 minute on medium heat. Remove the white membrane on the surface.
2. Wash and clean the pork tongue.
3. Remove the thorns from the root of the tongue and slice it crosswise into coin-thick slices.
4. Marinate the pork tongue by adding salt, white peppercorn powder, light soy sauce, potato starch, and sesame oil to a bowl. Mix well.
5. Prepare the other ingredients by cutting the large scallion into segments and shredding it vertically. Cut the small scallions into segments, cut the red pepper into strips, and cut the ginger into small strips.
6. Mix the sauce by adding beer, salt, MSG, white peppercorn powder, oyster sauce, and light soy sauce to a bowl. Mix well.
7. Heat up a wok and add oil. Once hot, add the marinated pork tongue and fry until medium well done. Remove and drain.
8. Pour out excess oil from the wok and add a small amount of base oil. Add in shredded big scallion and fry until browned. Remove them from the wok.
9. Add the small scallion white ends, ginger, and pepper strips to the wok. Stir-fry until aromatic, then add the pork tongue and stir-fry a few times.
10. Add the seasoning sauce and stir-fry a few more times.
11. Add the rest of the small scallions and serve.

## Tips:

- Best to choose fresh pork tongue.
- Fry the pork tongue in high oil temperature for a short period to make it crunchy.
- This dish needs to be cooked on a flame when stir-frying.
- Except for dishes in the fire stir-fried category, fires in the wok are not recommended for general stir-frying as it can make the dish taste slightly oily and smoky.
