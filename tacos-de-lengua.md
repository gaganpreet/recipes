Tongue Tacos (Tacos de lengua)

Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hour
Serves: 6–8
Ingredients

For the tongue:

- 1 beef tongue
- 1 onion, cut in wedges
- 1 head garlic, halved
- 3 bay leaves
- ½ teaspoon coriander seeds
- 2 ancho chiles, seeded
- 2 teaspoons salt

For the tacos:

- Oil / butter / ghee (to replace bone marrow salsa)
- 1 cup (40 g) chopped fresh cilantro (coriander) leaves
- Key lime wedges, for serving
- 1 white onion, finely chopped
- Fresh tortillas

## Instructions

Cook the tongue:
In a large pot, combine the tongue, onion, garlic, bay leaves, coriander seeds, and ancho chiles. Add water to cover by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes. Add the salt. Remove from the heat and let the tongue rest in the liquid for 20 minutes. When cool enough to handle but still hot, remove the tongue from the liquid and peel the outer layer with your hands. Cut the tongue into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces

## Prepare the tacos

Place a large cast-iron frying pan over high heat. Add oil and the tongue pieces and fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving container or vessel.
